## Game Overview
ActionMini is a horror/action game set in the woods. The player must find a cabin while avoiding monsters, grab a sword inside, then kill all the monsters to escape the woods. Built in Godot 4 for HTML5 (WebGL) browser play on itch.io.

## Rules
- This is a browser game, HTML5 (WebGL) for itch.io browser play, so keep that in mind and it needs to be optimised for that.
- Only edit .gd files don't touch any other files unless I tell you to, you can scan them if you want tho.
- So you can't access my Godot engine, so instead of assuming things about my scene setup, ask me questions or ask me for a screenshot.
