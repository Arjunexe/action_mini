So this game is a browser game, HTML5 (WebGL) for itch.io browser play, so keep that in mind and it needs to be optimised for that.
Also only edit .gd files don't touch any other files unless I tell you to, you can scan them if you want tho.
So you can't access my godot engine so if you have questions you can ask okay? try not to assume alot.
