So this game is a browser game, HTML5 (WebGL) for itch.io browser play, so keep that in mind and it needs to be optimised for that.
Also only edit .gd files don't touch any other files unless I tell you to, you can scan them if you want tho.
So you can't access my Godot engine, so instead of assuming things about my scene setup, ask me questions or ask me for a screenshot.
